# JSON Schema Spec

This directory contains several dialects of the JSON, also known
as meta-schema.
This is done using git submodules, so that the upstream version
can be tracked and updated easily.

The `2019-09` dialect is not really supported, nor is it intended
to be.
However, it is included here as an example of how multiple dialects
will be supported, looking forward to the next release.
