# JSON schema validator for JSON for Modern C++

# What is it?

This is a C++ library for validating JSON documents based on a
[JSON Schema](http://json-schema.org/) which itself should validate with
[draft-7 of JSON Schema Validation](http://json-schema.org/schema).

First a disclaimer: *It is work in progress and
contributions or hints or discussions are welcome.* Even though a 2.0.0 release is imminent.

Niels Lohmann et al develop a great JSON parser for C++ called [JSON for Modern
C++](https://github.com/nlohmann/json). This validator is based on this
library, hence the name.

External documentation is missing as well. However the API of the validator
is rather simple.

# New in version 2

Although significant changes have been done for the 2nd version
(a complete rewrite) the API is compatible with the 1.0.0 release. Except for
the namespace which is now `nlohmann::json_schema.

Version **2** supports JSON schema draft 7, whereas 1 was supporting draft 4
only. Please update your schemas.

The primary change in 2 is the way a schema is used. While in version 1 the schema was
kept as a JSON-document and used again and again during validation, in version 2 the schema
is parsed into compiled C++ objects which are then used during validation. There are surely
still optimizations to be done, but validation speed has improved by factor 100
or more.

# Design goals

The main goal of this validator is to produce *human-comprehensible* error
messages if a JSON-document/instance does not comply to its schema.

By default this is done with exceptions thrown at the users with a helpful
message telling what's wrong with the document while validating.

With **2.0.0** the user can pass a `json_schema::basic_error_handler`-derived
object along with the instance to validate to receive a callback each time a
validation error occurs and decide what to do (throwing, counting, collecting).

Another goal was to use Niels Lohmann's JSON-library. This is why the validator
lives in his namespace.

# Weaknesses

Numerical validation uses nlohmann integer, unsigned and floating point types, depending on if
the schema type is "integer" or "number". Bignum (i.e. arbitrary precision and
range) is not supported at this time.

# How to use

The current state of the build-system needs at least version **3.6.0** of NLohmann's
JSON library. It is looking for the `json.hpp` within a `nlohmann/`-path.

When build the library you need to provide the path to the directory where the include-file
is located as `nlohmann/json.hpp`.

## Build

### Within a build-dir

```Bash
git clone https://github.com/pboettch/json-schema-validator.git
cd json-schema-validator
mkdir build
cd build
cmake .. \
    -DNLOHMANN_JSON_DIR=<path/to/>nlohmann/json.hpp \
    -DJSON_SCHEMA_TEST_SUITE_PATH=<path/to/JSON-Schema-test-suite> # optional
make # install
ctest # run unit, non-regression and test-suite tests
```
### As a subdirectory from within

```CMake
# create an interface-target called json-hpp
add_library(json-hpp INTERFACE)
target_include_directories(json-hpp
    INTERFACE
        path/to/nlohmann/json.hpp)

# set this path to schema-test-suite to get tests compiled - optional
set(JSON_SCHEMA_TEST_SUITE_PATH "path/to/json-schema-test-suite")
enable_testing() # if you want to inherit tests

add_subdirectory(path-to-this-project json-schema-validator)
```

### Building a shared library

By default a static library is built. Shared libraries are generated by using
the `BUILD_SHARED_LIBS`-cmake variable:

In your initial call to cmake simply add:
```bash
cmake -DBUILD_SHARED_LIBS=ON
```
## Code

See also `app/json-schema-validate.cpp`.

```C++
#include <iostream>
#include <iomanip>

#include "json-schema.hpp"

using nlohmann::json;
using nlohmann::json_schema::json_validator;

// The schema is defined based upon a string literal
static json person_schema = R"(
{
    "$schema": "http://json-schema.org/draft-07/schema#",
    "title": "A person",
    "properties": {
        "name": {
            "description": "Name",
            "type": "string"
        },
        "age": {
            "description": "Age of the person",
            "type": "number",
            "minimum": 2,
            "maximum": 200
        }
    },
    "required": [
                 "name",
                 "age"
                 ],
    "type": "object"
}

)"_json;

// The people are defined with brace initialization
static json bad_person = {{"age", 42}};
static json good_person = {{"name", "Albert"}, {"age", 42}};

int main()
{
	/* json-parse the schema */

	json_validator validator; // create validator

	try {
		validator.set_root_schema(person_schema); // insert root-schema
	} catch (const std::exception &e) {
		std::cerr << "Validation of schema failed, here is why: " << e.what() << "\n";
		return EXIT_FAILURE;
	}

	/* json-parse the people - API of 1.0.0, default throwing error handler */

	for (auto &person : {bad_person, good_person}) {
		std::cout << "About to validate this person:\n"
		          << std::setw(2) << person << std::endl;
		try {
			validator.validate(person); // validate the document - uses the default throwing error-handler
			std::cout << "Validation succeeded\n";
		} catch (const std::exception &e) {
			std::cerr << "Validation failed, here is why: " << e.what() << "\n";
		}
	}

	/* json-parse the people - with custom error handler */
	class custom_error_handler : public nlohmann::json_schema::basic_error_handler
	{
		void error(const nlohmann::json_pointer<nlohmann::basic_json<>> &pointer, const json &instance,
			const std::string &message) override
		{
			nlohmann::json_schema::basic_error_handler::error(pointer, instance, message);
			std::cerr << "ERROR: '" << pointer << "' - '" << instance << "': " << message << "\n";
		}
	};


	for (auto &person : {bad_person, good_person}) {
		std::cout << "About to validate this person:\n"
		          << std::setw(2) << person << std::endl;

		custom_error_handler err;
		validator.validate(person, err); // validate the document

		if (err)
			std::cerr << "Validation failed\n";
		else
			std::cout << "Validation succeeded\n";
	}

	return EXIT_SUCCESS;
}
```

# Compliance

There is an application which can be used for testing the validator with the
[JSON-Schema-Test-Suite](https://github.com/json-schema-org/JSON-Schema-Test-Suite).
In order to simplify the testing, the test-suite is included in the repository.

If you have cloned this repository providing a path the repository-root via the
cmake-variable `JSON_SCHEMA_TEST_SUITE_PATH` will enable the test-target(s).

All required tests are **OK**.
